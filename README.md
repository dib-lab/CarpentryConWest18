- Other keynotes (TBD!) 
- Discussions about our new **Spanish curriculum**
- An introduction to **Binder** as an instructional tool and a hackyfest to *binderize* repositories

## Contibute your ideas!

Is there a specific issue or problem you want to tackle with your fellow Carpenters? Do you have a project or idea in the works that needs support or collaborators? We’re happy to facilitate! 

If you would like to propose an activity for Carpentry Con to run concurrently with other sessions, open an issue :point_up:.

## Cost

Registration is $50.

Housing is available, which includes breakfast and dinner (but not lunch). If you’re coming from afar, you’ll need to register *soon* to guarantee on-campus housing, which is an unbeatable deal and includes breakfast and dinner. 

## Code of Conduct

All contributions are expected to follow the Carpentries' [code of conduct](https://software-carpentry.org/conduct/).
