# Contribution guidance

We're organizing our work here to be more transparent, and invite participation from the Carpentry community at every opportunity. We use "Github Issues" to organize our discussions and ideas. Issues work a lot like email threads, and we welcome anyone to start or comment on a discussion.

Before you contribute, there are two things we ask you do:
* Please read & abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://software-carpentry.org/conduct/)
* Please be aware that all contributions will be licensed CC-BY.

## How to post or comment on an issue
1. Make sure you have a Github account, and are logged in. They're free and need very little information to make! You can get one [here](https://github.com/join).
2. Click on the [Issues tab](https://github.com/sparcopen/opencon/issues) while on our repository.
3. Get involved! You can make a new issue by clicking "New Issue" in the upper right hand corner. This will email OpenCon staff with your thoughts. Or, you can find an existing issue you'd like to comment on.
